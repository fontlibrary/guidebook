Guidebook
=========

#### HELLO, WELCOME TO THE GUIDEBOOK.

This is essentially a "How-to" guide for anything and everything you could possibly need or want regarding Font Library. To make things easy to digest, we separated all the pages into three categories: Contribute, Information and Technical. 

The Contribute category offers everything you will need to know to get involved in Open Font Library. As far as designing fonts this includes: how to actually [design a font](/font_design), what [formats](/font_formats) and [licenses are supported](/supported_licenses), and how to [submit](/submission_guidelines) and [update](/how_to_update_a_font) them when finished.

But if designing isn't your thing, you can always help out by [becoming a translator](/become-a-translator).

The Information section provides useful information for brushing up on general font knowledge. This includes [book recommendations](/book_recommendations), [knowledge resources](/knowledge_resources), and an explanation of what in the world [free/open fonts](/libre_open_fonts) actually are.

Lastly, the Technical section is for all you hardcore font designers. It's similar to the Contribute and Information categories, but everything in Technical is of a more thorough, specific nature. It features more complex information dealing with subjects like [collaborative design workflows](/collaborative_design_workflows), how to install the open source font editor [FontForge](/how_to_install_fontforge) and other [software resources](/software), and the specifications of [supported licenses](/supported_licenses)and [font packaging](/font_packaging).

We hope this helps. The Guidebook is meant to make your Font Library experience fun and successful. If it's failing in any way, please let us know - this will help make Font Library better for everyone involved. 

Thank you,\
The Font Library
